# SpringsScala
Sample Restful Services project in scala for Springs boot, Maven, Spring Security.

Spring is perhaps the most popular web development framework for the Java platform. Scala is a statically typed, functional programming language that runs on the JVM. Scala is highly interoperable with the Java language, so any Java lib can be used alongside Scala. Scala can be used along with Spring's ecosystem to build highly scalable, robust web applications.

This sample application illustrates how to use Spring with scala.

# Usage
